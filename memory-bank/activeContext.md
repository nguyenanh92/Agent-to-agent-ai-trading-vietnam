## Recent Key Decisions

### **Decision: Use VNStocks as Primary Data Source**
- **Date**: Recent (based on docs)
- **Rationale**: 
  - Official Vietnamese stock market library
  - Real-time data vs mock data
  - Comprehensive coverage of Vietnamese exchanges
- **Impact**: Significantly improved data accuracy and user trust

### **Decision: Implement Graceful Degradation**
- **Date**: Recent
- **Rationale**: 
  - APIs can fail or be slow
  - Users should always get some value
  - System should remain functional
- **Implementation**: Try real API â†’ cached data â†’ realistic mock â†’ basic fallback

### **Decision: Free-Text Stock Input**
- **Date**: Recent  
- **Rationale**:
  - Users know many stocks beyond predefined list
  - Vietnamese market has 1000+ symbols
  - Better user experience than dropdown
- **Implementation**: Text input with validation and suggestions

## Current Challenges

### **1. API Rate Limiting**
- **Issue**: Google Gemini free tier has 15 requests/minute limit
- **Impact**: May affect user experience during peak usage
- **Mitigation**: Parallel agent processing, efficient prompting
- **Next Steps**: Monitor usage patterns, consider paid tier

### **2. Data Freshness vs Performance**
- **Issue**: Balance between real-time data and system performance
- **Current Solution**: 5-minute caching for market data
- **Consideration**: May need to adjust based on user feedback

### **3. Agent Response Consistency**
- **Issue**: AI agents sometimes provide inconsistent analysis quality
- **Current Mitigation**: Detailed system prompts, fallback responses
- **Next Steps**: Refine prompts based on actual usage patterns

## Team Collaboration Context

### **Agent Personalities (Established)**
- **Nguyá»…n Minh Anh**: Senior Market Analyst, technical focus, data-driven
- **Tráº§n Quá»‘c Báº£o**: Senior Risk Manager, conservative, risk-focused  
- **LÃª Thá»‹ Mai**: Portfolio Manager, strategic, diversification-focused

### **Discussion Flow (Working Well)**
1. **Round 1**: Each agent provides initial analysis
2. **Round 2**: Agents respond to each other's perspectives
3. **Round 3**: Consensus building and final recommendations

### **Agent Interaction Quality**
- âœ… Agents have distinct personalities and speaking styles
- âœ… Natural Vietnamese language communication
- âœ… Professional-level analysis and reasoning
- ðŸ”„ Ongoing refinement of agent prompts and interactions

## Technical Debt & Maintenance

### **Low Priority Items**
- Legacy `vn_stock_api.py` file (replaced by VNStocks version)
- Some documentation files may need updates
- Test coverage could be expanded

### **Monitoring Requirements**
- VNStocks API availability and response times
- Google Gemini API quota usage
- Streamlit performance and memory usage
- User error rates and feedback
